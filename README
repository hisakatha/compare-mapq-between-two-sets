This program takes an alignment BAM file and two sets of chromosome (reference) names,
and outputs the highest MapQ scores in multiple alignment hits of one read for each set of chromosomes.
An alignment BAM file MUST be sorted by name beforehand.

An output for a read will be as follows:
read_name,top_mapq_in_set1,count_in_set1,top_mapq_in_set2,count_in_set2,abs_diff_in_mapq
